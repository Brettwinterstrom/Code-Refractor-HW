Code Refractor Hw
In this Hw assignment I was required to make website more accessible and make sure everything on the site worked as intended. In the html there were a lot of div tags that could be replaced with more precise tags like header, footer, article, nav, etc. to help with search engine optimization and readability. There were sections in the CSS where things could be consolidated so I changed the class names around and combined rule sets that were the same. This helped improve the readability. One of the links in the nav bar wasn't working in the html so I looked into it and found it didn't have an id associated with it so I added one. I added comments to both the html and the css explaining what the code does. Along the way I made commits and pushed to Github and made sure the website went live.
